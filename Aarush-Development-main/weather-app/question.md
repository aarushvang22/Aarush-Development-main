## 📌 Project Context

I'm working on a **minimal weather application** to practice full-stack development using Flask. The app will fetch and display real-time weather data using the [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) service.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Basic HTML and CSS (no frameworks)
- **Backend**: Python with Flask
- **API Source**: [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- **Goal**: Simple and clean user interface with only essential weather data.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

I want the user to enter a **city name**, and the app should:

1. Make a **GET request** to the WeatherAPI endpoint using Flask.
2. Parse the **current weather data** (like temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed).
3. Render it cleanly on a minimal HTML page using Flask templates.
4. Provide basic error handling (e.g., invalid city, empty input, API errors).

I'm aiming to keep everything **lightweight** and avoid external JS frameworks, frontend libraries, or complex templating engines.

## ❓ Question

What are the **best practices and recommendations** for building this project with the following in mind:

1. **Flask App Structure**:
   - How should I organize the routes, templates, and static files?
   - Should I use Blueprints even for small apps?

2. **API Integration**:
   - What’s the cleanest way to make the HTTP request to WeatherAPI within Flask?
   - How can I **securely manage the API key**, especially if I plan to host this later?

3. **Frontend Design**:
   - How can I keep the CSS responsive and minimal without using Bootstrap or Tailwind?
   - Suggestions for clean layout patterns for showing weather data?

4. **Error Handling**:
   - How can I gracefully show errors to the user if the API fails or the input is invalid?
   - Should I return to the same form with error messages or redirect?

5. **Optional Features**:
   - What are some small yet useful features I can add without breaking minimalism? (e.g., loading animation, location-based weather using IP)
