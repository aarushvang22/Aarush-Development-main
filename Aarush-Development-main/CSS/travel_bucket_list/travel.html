        <h1>My Travel Bucket List</h1>

        <h2 id="h2-1">San Francisco</h2>
        <p>I want to visit San Francisco in California because there are a lot of historical activities to do there. I can visit the Alcatraz Island, and I can see historical prisons and prisoners who were imprisoned there. I also want to visit a computer museum because my dream job is in cybersecurity. I also want to visit the a bridge because a basketball theme in the NBA was named after this bridge. The NBA stands for the National Basketball Association, where men play basketball, and that is a sport.</p>

        <h2 id="h2-2">Los Angeles</h2>
        <p>I want to visit Los Angeles because I want to visit a science observatory. There are also some studios that I can visit, which include Warner Brothers Studios, and Hollywood, where actors live. I want to visit the Warner Brothers Studios because I like Harry Potter, and Warner Brothers made the Harry Potter movies.</p>
