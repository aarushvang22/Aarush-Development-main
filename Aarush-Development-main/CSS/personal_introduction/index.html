        <h1>Aarush Vangipuram</h1>
        <p>Hi, My name is Aarush Vangipuram! I love coding because I might have to code while taking a job in cybersecurity. The college that I'll be applying to is Virginia Tech because I meet all the requirements needed to get there. I am really smart at Math and Science, but I'm weak at History and English. </p>
